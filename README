# Suguru Solver


## Puzzle Structure

Grid
    - a 2x2 list of the cells

Row
    - is returned when the Grid is indexed

Cell
    - is returned when the Row is indexed
    - contains a list of potential values

Group
    - stores the indexes of the cells in its group
    - is the main area of processing for the solver

## Solver

Phase 1: adjacent cell exclusion
    - for each filled cell, remove that value from all adjacent cells

Phase 2: group exclusion
    - for each filled cell in the group, remove that value from all the cells
    in the group

Phase 3: group multi-cell exclusion
    - find all the empty cells in the group
    - check if they all have at least one overlapping cell in their regions
    of influence (if not skip this phase)
    - for each possible remaining values in the group, check if the cells
    containing those values have an overlapping cell
    - remove that value from this cell


Optimisations?
    - have a buffer of changed cells (and groups) so we dont have to check
    every cell again individually


Baby solver ideas:
    - find largest group size, then fill every cell with a number smaller than
    that, then check the grid
    - get every permutation of values in each group and go through all of them
    then check the grid


## GUI suguru input

User steps:
    - select size of grid
    - create groups
        - click and drag on a series of cells and 
    - input cell values
    - hit 'solve'
